    "paragraph": "Typically, underlines, scribbles, and notes left in the margins by a former owner lower a bookâ€™s ______ when the former owner is a famous poet like Walt Whitman, such markings, known as marginalia, can be a gold mine to literary scholars.",
    "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",

      "B": "value",
      "C": "value,",
      "D": "value but"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction 'but' to join the first independent clause ('underlinesâ€¦lower a bookâ€™s value') and the second independent clause ('such markingsâ€¦can be a gold mine to scholars') to create a compound sentence."
